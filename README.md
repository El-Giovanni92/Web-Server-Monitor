# Project Description

This project is a web server built in Node.js, utilizing the Express framework and the EJS template engine. The server monitors and records the IP addresses of users accessing web pages, along with the date and number of accesses for each page. The data is stored in a database, and a web interface allows users to access statistics from the database. The web server pages describe a fictional company dedicated to environmental conservation.

## Getting Started

To replicate the functionality of the web server on your own machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Install Node.js along with its corresponding modules.
- Set up the database by opening the "database.sql" file with MySqlWorkbench and execute the script to create it and the corresponding table.
- Save the database access credentials in the corresponding structure within the main file `app.js`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the required modules.

### Usage

- Execute the program by running the script `npm start` with Nodemon or `node app.js`.
- Access the web server locally by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:3000` in your web browser.
- Explore the various pages using the provided links.
- View the interface displaying database statistics.
